cauliflower
-----------

Cauliflower is a simple CLI wrapper.  I'd written this same basic framework
three times for separate projects, so now I've yanked out the common code
to avoid writing it again.

This is meant to be a framework for building simple CLI tools that support
multiple commands.  (<code>git</code> is a good example of the type of what I
mean.)  It is mostly a wrapper around apache commons-cli 1.2.

Cauliflower requires Java 1.7.
